To protect your Personal Information, TyGAMES has set up a series of technological and organizational security measures to guarantee the security, integrity and confidentiality of your Personal Information. However, no method of sending data over the Internet or storing data can guarantee 100% security. TyGAMES is therefore unable to guarantee the complete security of your Personal Information.

If your Accounts and Personal Information are password-protected, it is your responsibility to keep your password safe. Do not disclose your password to anyone. If you share your computer, do not forget to log out before leaving a Service.

TyGAMES uses your Personal Information to answer specific enquiries, respond to purchase orders and send you order confirmations and other information relating to your account. TyGAMES also uses your Personal Information to operate and improve its Services. This information is used solely by TyGAMES with the aim of adapting the Services to meet users’ requirements.

If users are found to be blatantly misusing the Services, TyGAMES reserves the right to block specific User Accounts, specific IP addresses and specific console IDs and any type of device provided by the licensed hardware vendors. The IP address and console ID may be used to identify you with the aim of enforcing TyGAMES’s Terms of Service.

We may use your date of birth or age to screen access to our forums according to their official age restrictions. TyGAMES cannot monitor every chat room and therefore makes no such warranty. However, TyGAMES reserves the right at its sole discretion to delete any content in your posts without prior notice. All such data collected may be used by TyGAMES to enforce its Terms of Service, uphold the law and protect its rights and those of its subsidiaries and other users, as well as for the security of its employees and users. This information may be sent to any law enforcement or government officials.

If you opted to receive emails from TyGAMES when creating your User Account, you will receive emails relating to TyGAMES’s products and special offers. We will use the Personal Information that you provided during registration. You can opt out of this TyGAMES service at any time.

TyGAMES may display ads on the pages of its Websites. Such ads mainly concern TyGAMES’s Services. We may compile information about the sponsored links that you or other people using your computer have clicked via cookies to offer you ads that TyGAMES believes correspond to your centers of interest.

Services may contain links to websites other than TyGAMES, such as YouTube, Facebook and other social networking sites. If you click on a link to a third-party website, you understand and agree to leave the Services governed by our policies and that TyGAMES has no control over such third-party websites.

Your information will be collected and used by the teams working for TyGAMES.

Sharing your Personal Information with third-party companies

When navigating on TyGAMES Websites or using TyGAMES games, external service providers may collect your Personal Information on behalf of TyGAMES. These third parties are contracted by TyGAMES to effectively provide such services as processing credit card payments, delivering products and awarding prizes or free products as part of special offers, and other services provided as part of TyGAMES’s Services. Except where a third party asks you to accept its own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, these third parties will only share your Personal Information with TyGAMES.

TyGAMES will never share Personal Information with external companies for marketing and/or commercial purposes without having first obtained your authorization or the consent of a parent or guardian in case of users under the age of 13 (thirteen).

Offer walls
TyGAMES games and their purchase pages feature an “offer wall” hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third-party advertisers to give users virtual money in return for interacting with an ad or carry out a marketing campaign that includes opening an account with one of the advertisers. Such offers do not come from TyGAMES. These offers are presented according to certain technical information, such as the geographic area or anonymous demographic information. If you click on an ad, you will leave the site hosted by TyGAMES or its partner social networking site. To correctly credit the User Account and avoid any fraud, a unique identifier (sometimes your user name) will be shared with the offer wall provider.

Sharing with authorities

TyGAMES may need to disclose Personal Information to law enforcement and government officials when required to identify, question and prosecute any individual likely to violate the rights of TyGAMES, any user or third party. Finally, TyGAMES may be legally required and forced to disclose Personal Information.

Your information and all the content of your posts (including but not limited to chat, voice calls, IP addresses and your Personal Information) may be viewed and monitored in accordance with the requirements of the Service and may be disclosed:

- When we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is required in pursuance of legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena).  To meet any applicable law or regulation. 
- When we believe that the Service is being use to commit a criminal offence (including the exchange of information with other companies for the purpose of preventing fraud or the risk of insolvency).
- When we have a good-faith belief that there is an emergency representing a threat to your health and/or safety or to the health and safety of another person or the public in general.
- To protect TyGAMES’s rights and property 

Sharing in case of a merger

Third parties may have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of negotiations aimed at transferring all or part of TyGAMES’s activities. For this sole purpose, TyGAMES may allow your Personal Information to be transferred, including data identifying minors.

If TyGAMES’s business activities are transferred, such as through a merger, acquisition by another company or the sale of all or part of its products or assets, your Personal Information could potentially be transferred. In case of a major change to our privacy practices following a business transfer, we will send you notice thereof prior to transferring your Personal Information.

5) TyGAMES’s special efforts to protect minors

Our Websites and games are not intended for minors under the age of 13 and we will not intentionally collect their Personal Information. Minors under the age of 13 must not use our Websites or our games. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from minors under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such information from our files.
We know that we have a special obligation to protect children’s Personal Information. In case of children less than 13 wishing to use the Services, prior written permission or any other verifiable consent must be received from their parent or legal guardian.

6.2. Users warrant that they hold all the rights relating to the User Content published.
By uploading any type of User Content whatsoever (including but not limited to images, videos, submitted ideas, suggestions and posts) to the Site, Users grant (or, if applicable, represent and warrant that the holder has expressly granted them the rights) to TyGAMES, for the purpose of operating and providing the Service in the interest of the User and others, an irrevocable, worldwide and royalty- free right and licence, for the term of copyright protection stipulated by French intellectual property law, and which will be granted in the future, especially in case of an extension inuring to the benefit of the copyright holders or their heirs, whether by statute or rule of law, custom, court or arbitrary decision, or by international treaties, agreements, decisions, directives, regulations or conventions, to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, exploit, execute, communicate, represent, translate, sub-license, create derivative works and distribute User Content or incorporate User Content in any form, by any medium and using any known or currently unknown technology whatsoever, and Users consequently agree to any use for these purposes. If TyGAMES wishes to use the User Content for any other purpose, TyGAMES will obtain prior consent from the User.

Users acknowledge that they have been informed that TyGAMES or its partners may take technological protection measures to exploit all or part of the User Content. Upon sending written request to TyGAMES by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, Users may be given access within a reasonable period of time to the main characteristics of the said technological protection measures that TyGAMES has actually implemented to exploit the User Content.

Users and TyGAMES expressly agree that any claims, requests or actions initiated by Users to seek payment of royalties, indemnification or compensation, may not be held as grounds for terminating or invalidating the contract and/or rights and the licence that TyGAMES has granted to the User in respect of the User Content, but will remain restricted to a dispute concerning the type or amount of royalties, indemnification or compensation sought, where such dispute may only be resolved by the payment or nonpayment of a sum, but where the User does not have the right to dispute or challenge the rights granted to TyGAMES in respect of the User Content.

To the extent permitted by law, Users hereby acknowledge and accept, and in full consideration of the type of Services hereunder, that they are aware of the risks inherent in distributing User Content and adapting and/or modifying such Content, and Users accept this eventuality. Furthermore and for the same reasons, Users acknowledge that their name and their status as the author may be systematically associated with the User Content, which Users accept.

Such consent is not only granted in respect of the User’s proprietary rights, but also their moral rights. Users acknowledge and accept that their moral rights are likely to be subject to their consent and are neither unlimited, discretionary nor absolute.

6.3. Users are fully and solely liable for the lawfulness and use of the User Content posted and transmitted via the Services and therefore hold TyGAMES harmless against any third-party claims and/or actions.

In no event will TyGAMES be liable if User Content is held to be unlawful or used in an unlawful manner.

If Users suspect that another User is making illegal use of the Services, such as by posting unlawful content, they agree to click on the “Report Abuse” link or any similar link and/or contact the TyGAMES Customer Support Department directly to report such abuse.

TyGAMES has the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately delete seemingly unlawful Content, especially any User Content that has been subject to a claim and which is likely to violate third-party rights and/or conflict with these Terms. Users expressly accept this right of TyGAMES and agree to waive any claims against TyGAMES if User Content is deleted for any reason whatsoever.

TyGAMES may check and/or record Users’ interactions with the Services or their communications (including but not limited to chat messages and voice communications).

TyGAMES reserves the right to restrict the storage capacity available to Users for uploading Content.

6.4. Users warrant that any User Content uploaded is:

 Accurate and not confidential.  Not in violation of any applicable rules of law, contractual terms or any other third-party rights; if applicable, Users must have authorisation from the third parties whose personal information and/or intellectual property is included in the User Content.  Free from any viruses, adware, spyware, worms or other malware.  In compliance with these Terms and especially the obligations set forth in Section 9.

7. Personal Information

7.1. In pursuance of France’s Data Protection Act 1978, as amended, TyGAMES hereby informs Users that it protects the confidentiality, integrity and security of any information that they might be required to provide in using the Services or Site.

Any personal information that identifies the User directly, such as their last name, first name, postal address, email address and telephone number, or indirectly, according to applicable legislation, will be deemed confidential and treated as such.

When Users create an Account, TyGAMES is responsible for processing their personal information, which Users accept.

As required by the foregoing act, TyGAMES is duly registered with France’s data protection authority (CNIL) to process personal information, under registration number 1584940 v 0. TyGAMES updates its registration with CNIL as necessary.

The data collected come from people providing their information as part of their desire to access or use the Services and become a User.

Data may be used to manage the operations carried out over the Site, particularly access to and use of the Services.

TyGAMES keeps Users’ personal information on file for the duration required to satisfy the aims of this Section and for the purpose of defending its contractual and/or tortious liability. Upon expiration of this duration, only anonymous statistical data are retained and will not be exploited in any manner whatsoever.

Subject to providing evidence of their identity, Users have the right to access, amend, correct and delete their personal information either via their Account or by writing to TyGAMES at the following email address: hello@ty.games, or the following postal address: TyGAMES 3A rue de Paris, Cesson-Sevigne , France.

7.2. TyGAMES uses cookies to collect browsing information for statistical purposes. Users must agree to the use of cookies for any free or premium subscription.

TyGAMES also reserves the right to collect certain types of information relating to the User’s computer (IP address, ISP, hardware, software configuration, etc.) and the Services (log and history of all data exchanged, log and history of all logins, etc.).

TyGAMES may use this information for any purposes whatsoever, especially for improving Users’ experience of the Services and ensuring Users’ compliance with these Terms.

TyGAMES may use all the information available on its servers to carry out any types of checks for the purpose of preventing and sanctioning violations of these Terms.

7.3. TyGAMES generally agrees to never disclose Users’ personal information, except where consent has specifically been obtained from the Users or in exceptional circumstances as described below.

TyGAMES has listed the following cases where Users’ personal information may be subject to disclosure:

– It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside the User’s country of residence − for TyGAMES to disclose the aforementioned personal information.

– TyGAMES may also disclose such information if disclosure is necessary for purposes of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance.

– TyGAMES may also disclose Users’ personal information if disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce these Terms or protect its operations or Users.

– In the event of a reorganisation, TyGAMES may transfer any and all personal information collected to the relevant third party.

8. Hypertext Links

The Site may contain hypertext links to third-party content or websites, including other websites operated by TyGAMES or its partners.

TyGAMES is not responsible for the quality or accuracy of such content or websites, and a link does not constitute TyGAMES’s endorsement, publication or authorisation of said websites or content.

Consequently, the operators of said websites are solely responsible for complying with applicable legislation and regulations, especially in respect of the products and services advertised for sale on their website and particularly in terms of consumer protection, distance selling, price regulation, personal data protection and so on.

TyGAMES disclaims any and all liability for any damage caused by the use of such websites.

9. Intellectual Property

9.1. Users are granted a licence to access and use the Services solely for personal purposes to the extent permitted by the rights under such licence. Users may not use the Services other than in accordance with the rights under the licence granted. In using the Services provided, Users agree to use the said Services as part of a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence.

9.2. Users may under no circumstances consider that they have any title to the digital files of the content for which they have been granted usage rights. Physical control over the files is only granted to allow Users to enjoy the rights granted under the licence, and such files are only incidental to the rights under the licence granted.

The licence may not be transferred, due to the specific commitments binding the User under these Terms.

Any reproduction or representation, whether in full or in part, for purposes other than the User’s personal use on any medium whatsoever is prohibited. Failure to comply with this provision will constitute a breach of these Terms and may incur the infringer’s civil and criminal liability.

9.3. The names, images, logos and any other distinguishing marks on the Site that identify TyGAMES, its partners or third parties, or their products and services, including the Services offered by TyGAMES, are content protected by intellectual property rights, trademark rights, design rights, specific database producer rights and/or copyright and neighbouring rights in France and abroad. Any unauthorised reproduction and/or use may constitute a criminal offence or give rise to civil liability.

The Services and their content (including but not limited to games, titles, characters, dialogue, stories, artwork, musical compositions, software, visuals and audiovisual effects), the Site, the general structure of the Site, the editorial content, images, sounds, videos, multimedia, text, photos, drawings, icons, software, databases used and all other content on the Site are protected by copyright, neighbouring rights and/or sui generis database producer rights, as well as applicable international agreements.

TyGAMES, its partners and third parties alone hold the aforementioned intellectual property rights for all the items on the Site and/or provided by TyGAMES as part of the Services.

Users agree to abide by these rights.

Subject to civil and/or criminal action and except where consent has been specifically obtained from TyGAMES, Users agree not to:

– Reproduce, represent, modify, publish, adapt on any medium or by any means whatsoever all the items on the Site and the Services.

– Interfere with the computer systems implemented to deliver the Services, including any intrusions or attempted intrusions.

– Reverse engineer all or part of the Services.

– Compile, decompile or disassemble all or part of the Services.

– Modify or create programmes developed from all or part of the Services, including for the purpose of correcting any errors, insofar as TyGAMES alone is authorised to perform such corrections.

– Distribute and/or disseminate copies of all or part of the Services.

– Remove or delete all notices and/or proprietary information on all or part of the Services.

– Resell, rent, sub-let or transfer the Services to a third party in any manner whatsoever.

Any use, reproduction or representation, whether in full or in part, of the distinguishing marks or items on the Site without prior written consent from TyGAMES, its partners or third parties, is prohibited and will constitute a violation of criminal and civil laws.

9.4. Users acknowledge that they have no title to the content available through the Services, including but not limited to the Virtual Items that appear in the Services, irrespective of whether the User has “earned” or purchased such items from TyGAMES, and no title to any other attributes associated with an Account or stored on the Services.

TyGAMES prohibits and does not recognise, except where authorisation has expressly been given, purported transfers of Virtual Items outside of its Services, or the purported sale, gift or trade of any items whatsoever appearing in its Services in the “real world”. Accordingly, Users may not trade, sell or attempt to sell Virtual Items for legal currency, or trade Virtual Items for any type of goods whatsoever outside the game, without written consent from TyGAMES. Such transfers or attempted transfers are prohibited and have no legal value whatsoever. If necessary, TyGAMES will terminate and close the Account of any Users involved in such activities, without prejudice to any other rights of TyGAMES in respect of infringement.

9.5. The digital files on the Site may be protected by technological protection measures or digital rights management systems to control the use of such files and prevent them from being copied. These measures and systems are aimed at giving Users maximum flexibility in using the content made available, while protecting the rights of authors, artists and content publishers.

Users shall not take any action aimed at circumventing or infringing the digital content protection systems. Users shall not violate, in any way whatsoever, the reproduction, representation and other rights held by the content’s publishers.

Technological protection measures and digital rights management systems are governed by French intellectual property law. Any attempt to circumvent these measures or systems is subject to the penalties set forth in that law. More generally, any use of the digital files other than in accordance with these Terms may be construed as an act of infringement, which may result in criminal or civil penalties by violating applicable laws and regulations.

In consideration of the legal technological measures and digital rights management systems in pursuance of French intellectual property law, Users may not transfer the licence, content or digital files to a third party.

TyGAMES does not warrant that the Services offered will always be available.

Wherever possible, TyGAMES will use its best efforts to keep the Site and Services accessible, but is under no obligation to achieve same. In this respect, TyGAMES reserves the right to suspend access to all or part of the Site or Services without prior notice, especially to carry out corrections, updates and maintenance.

In consideration of the technical issues inherent in the decentralised operation of the Internet, TyGAMES cannot warrant that the Site and Services will function continuously or be free from errors.

Therefore, TyGAMES and its partners will not be liable for any faults in Service performance or the Services’ merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no event will TyGAMES be liable for any interrupted access to all or part of the Services and/or Site, especially when the Site and/or Services are undergoing corrections, updates or maintenance.
